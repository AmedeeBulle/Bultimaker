# bUltimaker

bUltimaker is an online firmware builder for Ultimaker Original and
Original+ 3D printers.

It offers a simple web interface to build an Ultimaker firmware from sources.

It is aimed at (advanced) end-users who want/need to build a custom firmware
for their Ultimaker Original printer.  
Build options are limited and constrained to ensure _safe_ builds.

If you are an expert users/developer who want to set and try all possible
options, this builder is probably not for you ;)

The builder evolves in parallel with the associated firmware branches:
- [Marlin for Ultimaker Original / Original+](https://github.com/AmedeeBulle/Marlin/tree/Marlin_UMO_Unified) (Stable)
- [Marlin for Ultimaker Original / Original+](https://github.com/AmedeeBulle/Marlin/tree/Marlin_UMO_Unified_Experimental) (Experimental)

It will **not** work with other Marlin forks.

The features supported by the builder are listed in the README file of the 
associated firmware repository.
